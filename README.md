WMD / ExZo — Free Assets & Files

This repository contains free assets for:

Weapons of Mass Dysfunction (WMD)

Exclusion//Zone (ExZo)

They’re here because I want them to be easy to access, easy to use, and easy to share.

If you are here for the Weapons of Mass Dysfunction Ruleset, the most recent version is 0.4.0b.
Click https://github.com/jettvex/The-Nanarchy-Archives/blob/main/Ruleset_v0.4.0.pdf to download it.

Why this is so open

Because policing free stuff is exhausting.
Because people are going to resell and redistribute it anyway.
Because I’d rather spend my time making things than getting mad online.
